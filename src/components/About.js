        Whether you're just starting to learn to program for the first time or
        you've been working as a developer for years, having a mentor is one of
        the most effective ways to continue improving and ensure you're
        constantly expanding your skill-set. Studies show that learning
        one-on-one with a teacher can drastically impact your performance and
        ability to improve. Coding-AI will try to match you with a mentor
        because of how difficult it was to find mentors when learning to code.
        With so many people entering the engineering world, mentorship is in
        high demand, and time is a valuable resource for most successful coders.
