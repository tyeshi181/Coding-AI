       In today’s society, technology has become the world. 
       Technology is shaping the world and many people are using it for its convenience. 
       Technology has changed tremendously that it is now being incorporated into the educational system. Heidi Hayes Jacobs, an author and world renowned education leader stated that, “Teachers need to integrate technology seamlessly into the curriculum instead of viewing it as an add-on, an afterthought, or an event”.
